# OOSD-Project-2
2nd major project from OOSD class, this one using C# and ASP MVC.NET core

This project was created as an MVC app, similarly to Project 1 we worked in groups. I was on a team with 3 individuals who have commented their names in the code, unfortunately I am unable to attain links to their personal GitHub accounts. In this project we used scaffolding to create database connection. We did similar projects utilizing code-first database creation rather than using a pre-created database.

This was intended to be a web app that would allow agents of this 'travel experts' agency to add and view products/suppliers/etc,. allowing modification, addition and removal.
